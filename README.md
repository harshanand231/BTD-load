Brain Tumor Detection

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for detecting brain tumors using MRI scans. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deployed as a Flask API for easy inference.

## Getting Started

First, 
fork the repo.
then,
run the development server:

```bash
python app.py
# or
flask --app.py
```
## API Keys, Secret Keys

In .env file which in ignored in gitignore

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `templates/index.html in github i putted index.html outside because it was not rendeering from inside`.
The page auto-updates as you edit the file

## Features

Deep Learning Model: CNN-based image classification.

Preprocessing: Image normalization and augmentation.

Training & Evaluation: TensorFlow/Keras with accuracy and loss tracking.

Deployment: Flask API for predictions.

## Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

Flask

PostgreSQL (for login signup database)

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for frontend UI)

Google Developer Console for Sign-up with google

### Installation

Model Training

Flask API for Prediction

## Usage

Upload an MRI scan image via the Flask API.

The model will analyze and predict if a tumor is present.

The results will be displayed as JSON output.

Future Enhancements

Improve accuracy with transfer learning.

Deploy a web-based UI using React.
