# Brain-Tumour
Brain Tumor Detection

Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for brain tumor detection using MRI scan images.

Features

Deep Learning Model: CNN-based classification.

Preprocessing: Image normalization and augmentation.

Training & Evaluation: TensorFlow/Keras with accuracy and loss tracking.

Deployment: Flask API for predictions.

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV

Flask

PostgreSQL (optional for metadata storage)

React.js (for frontend UI)

Installation

Model Training

Flask API for Prediction

Usage

Upload an MRI scan image via the Flask API.

The model will analyze and predict if a tumor is present.

The results will be displayed as JSON output.

Future Enhancements

Improve accuracy with transfer learning.

Deploy a web-based UI using React.
